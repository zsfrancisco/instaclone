# Instaclone
It's an application like instagram, I did it following the course [Crea un Instagram con React, GraphQL, Apollo, MongoDB y AWS](https://www.udemy.com/course/crea-tu-red-social-con-react-graphql-apollo-mongodb-y-aws/), it was really amazing, you can upload photos, like it, comment it, sing in, etc.

I applied the better practices that I know.
